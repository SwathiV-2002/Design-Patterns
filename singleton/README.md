Notepad.ts: Defines the Notepad class.
NotepadManager.ts: Implements the NotepadManager Singleton class.
main.ts: Entry point of the application.



The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.
