Implement Concrete Sorting Strategies:
Ascending sort strategy.
Descending sort strategy.
Alphabetical sort strategy.

Implement the Sorter Context:
A sorter class that uses a sorting strategy to sort data.
The sorter can change its strategy at runtime.

Index
Create instances of different sorting strategies.
Use the sorter with different strategies to sort data.
Demonstrate changing strategies and sorting data again.
