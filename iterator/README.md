The iterator design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern is useful when you need to traverse a collection of objects in a uniform way.

Key Components
Iterator: Defines an interface for accessing and traversing elements.
Concrete Iterator: Implements the iterator interface and keeps track of the current position in the traversal.
Aggregate: Defines an interface for creating an iterator object.
Concrete Aggregate: Implements the aggregate interface and returns an instance of the concrete iterator.
